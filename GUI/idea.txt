to make the hand work in pygame, have a list of rects that will be the texture
and button pairs. update the button when moving cards around and leave the
texture alone since it is dependent on what card it is. then, have Derrek's 
function place them and when a mouse hovers over one use
Rect.collidepoint(mouse) to see which one is being pressed, and return its
index in the list of rects so that the game logic knows which card is being
selected. Only allow selection of card to be done on player turn

card dimensions: 71 x 107
